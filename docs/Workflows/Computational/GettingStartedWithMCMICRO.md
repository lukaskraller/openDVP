# Setup imaging processing pipelines for the MDC

### Setting Expectations

If you want to run an image processing and analyis pipeline, it will take some time to setup.  
Depending on your familiarity to things like HPC, Nextflow, Snakemake, Python; the amount of effort will vary.

### General tips

- Before running your full data, try things out with very small data(<100MB). Where the feedback loop is less than 2 minutes. This will allow you to play with settings, parameters, and lower the cost of failure. You will fail, and you will learn.
- Asking LLMs for help is great, just be careful, some of these pipelines and packages are not very popular and there are tendencies to hallucinate.
- Ask humans for help, but help with log files, tracebacks, and context. Just like LLMs the more context the better we understand your problem.

## MCMICRO

MCMICRO is a wonderful pipeline developed by a group of image analysts. It runs on [Nextflow](https://www.nextflow.io/) which allows it to be run on any computational environment. It is powerful, modular, and scalable. Once setup it can be ran in parallel with as many files as your compute allows.

For a conceptual overview read the paper [MCMICRO paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41592-021-01308-y), for a more technical overview I suggest you first read the documentation of the [MCMICRO website ](https://mcmicro.org/overview/) and define what steps are important for your workflow.

## How to setup in the BIH HPC

### Step 1: Ensure you can access the cluster

Please take the time to read and go through the documentation at [Getting Access](https://hpc-docs.cubi.bihealth.org/admin/getting-access/).

<details>
<summary> Check access is working, you see this message: </summary>

```bash

❯ ssh jnimoca_m@hpc-login-1.cubi.bihealth.org
Welcome to the BIH HPC 4 Research Cluster!

 You are on a login node.
 You should not do much here besides starting "screen"/"tmux"
 and using Slurm commands such as "sbatch"/"srun" for connecting to nodes.

[jnimoca_m@hpc-login-1 ~]$

```

</details>

### Step 2: Ensure you can move files to cluster

Follow [BIH HPC instructions](https://hpc-docs.cubi.bihealth.org/how-to/service/file-exchange/) for using software to transfer files.
Technically you should be able to connect from virtual machines. Sometimes there are issues with IP adresses, please contact IT for help.

<details>
<summary> Check if it is working </summary>
You are able to drag and drop files, and you see them in the command line.
</details>


### Step 3: Ensure there is enough space in your directory

Familiarize yourself with how [storage works in the BIH HPC](https://hpc-docs.cubi.bihealth.org/storage/storage-locations/).

In the terminal, connect to the HPC. Go to your home directory and check what is there with `ls`

```bash
# Your home directory should look something like this:
[jnimoca_m@hpc-login-1 ~]$ ls
bin  ondemand  scratch  work
```

To know how much data there is please check [BIH HPC dashboard](https://hpc-access.cubi.bihealth.org/)  
Consider that for each 10gb of raw data you will need approx. 100gb of storage space.  
If you need more storage space, bring it up in meeting or Mattermost. We might have to ask for extra storage.

### Step 4: Create environment in the HPC to run nextflow pipelines

```python
# these are the problems

# (1) Java
[jnimoca_m@hpc-login-1 ~]$ java -version
-bash: java: command not found
#(2) Nextflow
[jnimoca_m@hpc-login-1 ~]$ nextflow
-bash: /data/cephfs-1/home/users/jnimoca_m/bin/nextflow: No such file or directory
```

We will use **miniforge**(Conda analogue) to install these, please read the [Software Installation with Conda](https://hpc-docs.cubi.bihealth.org/best-practice/software-installation-with-conda/).

```python
# ensure you are running an interactive session in the HPC
#this commands creates and interactive session with more computational resources
hpc-login-1:~$ srun --mem=5G --pty bash -i
hpc-cpu-123:~$ wget https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge/releases/latest/download/Miniforge3-Linux-x86_64.sh
hpc-cpu-123:~$ bash Miniforge3-Linux-x86_64.sh -b -f -p $HOME/work/miniforge
hpc-cpu-123:~$ eval "$(/$HOME/work/miniforge/bin/conda shell.bash hook)"
hpc-cpu-123:~$ conda init
hpc-cpu-123:~$ conda config --set auto_activate_base false

# these commands to ensure conda channel is not used
hpc-cpu-123:~$ conda config --add channels bioconda
hpc-cpu-123:~$ conda config --add channels conda-forge
hpc-cpu-123:~$ conda config --set channel_priority strict
```

Conda hopefully is properly installed.

<details>
<summary> Reasoning question: Why did it take so long to run that small (400mb) dataset?</summary>

Because you ran that entire analysis in that single node, with the default resources.  
When you run your dataset nextflow will dispatch jobs based on the requirements of each process.

</details>

### Step 6: How to run MCMICRO with HPC job

Let's rerun the same dataset with a script

```bash
# let's create the script file

# go to demo data
(mcmicro) [jnimoca_m@hpc-cpu-213 ~]$ cd work/test1/exemplar-001/
# create script file
(mcmicro) [jnimoca_m@hpc-cpu-213 exemplar-001]$ touch script.sh
# edit script 
(mcmicro) [jnimoca_m@hpc-cpu-213 exemplar-001]$ nano script.sh 
# then you type everything you need and press (CTRL+X) to leave
# consider creating this file in a text editor (VSCode) and copy paste into it
```

Here is the demo script:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
#SBATCH --job-name=test_job         # Job name
#SBATCH --time=4:00:00              # Time limit hrs:min:sec
#SBATCH --mem=10G                   # Memory for orchestrating node
#SBATCH --cpus-per-task=2           # Number of CPU cores for orchestrating node

eval "$(conda shell.bash hook)"     # This exposes conda hook to node
conda activate mcmicro              # This activates environment in node
PATH_TO_DATA="/data/cephfs-1/home/users/jnimoca_m/work/test1/exemplar-001"
nextflow run labsyspharm/mcmicro --in $PATH_TO_DATA -profile singularity
```

Then run your script:

```bash
#the location of the script doesnt matter as long as the path in it directs to your data
(mcmicro) [jnimoca_m@hpc-cpu-213 exemplar-001]$ sbatch demo_script.sh 
sbatch: routed your job to partition short
Submitted batch job 18622303
```

### Project organization

Minimum requiremets are the following:

```bash
myproject/
├── markers.csv
├── params.yml
└── raw/
```
### markers.csv

- cannot be renamed
- column names must be: `cycle_number`, `channel_number`, and `marker_name`
- `marker_name` values must all be unique
- Separator **must** be a *comma* (,) -- Be careful with excel and german defaults, use libreOffice if needed.

markers.csv schema (without background subtraction):

### params.yml

Familiarize yourself with the [official documentation](https://mcmicro.org/parameters/)

- holds all parameters, for the pipeline and for each module
- must be a `.yml` file
- must be passed with `nextflow run ... --params params.yml

Example params.yml for just **stitching and registration** of a `.czi` file:

```yml
workflow:
start-at: illumination
stop-at: registration

options:
    ashlar: --flip-y --align-channel 1 -m 50 --filter-sigma 1
```

Example params.yml including **background subtraction**

```yml
workflow:
    start-at: illumination
    stop-at: background
    background: true
    background-method: backsub

options:
    ashlar: --flip-y --align-channel 4 -m 50 --filter-sigma 1
```

### Considerations, ideas, and tips

- You do not have to run everything all the time, sometimes I like to run MCMICRO just for (1) Illumination correction and (2) Stitching and registration and the move on to another software. Make use of the workflow options like `stop-at`.  
- Inside the [nextflow.config](https://github.com/labsyspharm/mcmicro/blob/master/nextflow.config) file, MCMICRO developers link the default computational requirements for each module. They have set `profiles`. For example here you can find the [WSI defaults](https://github.com/labsyspharm/mcmicro/blob/master/config/nf/wsi.config) profile optimized for Whole slide imaging, and here the `profile` for  [TMA defaults](https://github.com/labsyspharm/mcmicro/blob/master/config/nf/tma.config). If you feel you need your own computational requirements, I suggest you fork the MCMICRO github repository, modify it, and then run mcmicro like this `nextflow run josenimo/mcmicro`. Nextflow is smart and will use that github repository instead.
- For MDC peeps, feel free to use [josenimo/mcmicro](https://github.com/josenimo/mcmicro/) with `-profile singularity` in your `nextflow run` command. 
- Nextflow has a nice `-resume` parameter to automatically check what already ran, and go on from there.

## SOPA

SOPA is a wonderful pipeline, similar to MCMICRO but has some fundamental differences.

Similarly, for a overview of SOPA read the [paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-48981-z), for a more technical overview visit the [website](https://gustaveroussy.github.io/sopa/).

General:

- SOPA runs on [Snakemake](https://snakemake.github.io/), nextflow version is in [development](https://nf-co.re/sopa/usage).
- SOPA uses the Spatialdata object natively, some experience with SpatialData is recommended.

Advantages:

- SOPA can run on Windows.
- SOPA is easier to customize than MCMICRO. For adding a function quickly to your pipeline use this (Python required).
- SOPA can be used in four flavours: jupyter notebooks with python API, snakemake, nextflow, and CLI.
- SOPA is compatible with various modalities:  Xenium, Visium HD, MERSCOPE, CosMx, PhenoCycler, MACSima, Molecular Cartography.

Disadvantages:

- More modality compatibility leads to complexity of setup.
- SOPA cannot perform **Illumination correction**, **Stitching and Registration**, or **Background Subtraction**.(Jose is considering helping out SOPA devs with these).
- Output is spatialdata object, not super friendly to get data out of.
- Segmentation output is `.geojson` not `.tif` (you can convert easily with spatialdata function).

## Setup SOPA locally in your computer (for testing subsets)

- Familiarize yourself with the [Snakemake framework](https://snakemake.github.io/).
- Follow SOPA [Getting Started](https://gustaveroussy.github.io/sopa/getting_started/).
- Follow SOPA's [snakemake tutorial](https://gustaveroussy.github.io/sopa/tutorials/snakemake/).

### Step 1: Ensure you have conda/mamba installed

- Download micromamba from [Micromamba Releases](https://github.com/mamba-org/micromamba-releases/releases). You might have to click `show all 27 assets` to see the version you need.
- Check that you can create environments and download packages

### Step 2: Create sopa environment

```python
# from SOPA user guide, tested by Jose
# every line is one command that must be ran one at a time.
conda create --name sopa python=3.10
conda activate sopa

pip install sopa
pip install snakemake

# you can decide which segmentation tool to use, let's use cellpose
pip install 'sopa[cellpose]'

# for some reason cellpose >4 breaks sopa, we have to uninstall and install cellpose 3
pip uninstall cellpose
pip install 'cellpose <4.0.0'
```

### Step 3: Download sopa defaults

SOPA have many processes, and many processes are modality specific. You can concatenate them as you want (not simple, not super complex either). To simplify things for now, We will use SOPA-provided defaults for dealing with ome.tif

```bash
# in the terminal, go to directory you know
# this will download the entire github repository
git clone https://github.com/gustaveroussy/sopa.git
```

### Step 4: Edit default parameters

Open the following file inside the downloaded `sopa` directory:
`sopa/workflow/configs/misc/ome_tif.yaml`

This is the parameter file that sets the parameters for all the processes.  
For a deeper look into what each of these does check [parameter_guide](https://github.com/gustaveroussy/sopa/blob/main/workflow/config/example_commented.yaml)

We will change the cellpose parameters to the following to make it work with our demo image.

```yaml
# these are the settings you should have (ensure you save the file after you are done).
read:
  technology: ome_tif

patchify:
  patch_width_pixel: 400
  patch_overlap_pixel: 40

segmentation:
  cellpose:
    model_type: "nuclei"
    diameter: 25
    channels: [ "DAPI_bg" ]
    flow_threshold: 2
    cellprob_threshold: -6
    min_area: 25
    gaussian_sigma: 1

aggregate:
  aggregate_channels: true
  min_intensity_ratio: 0.1
  expand_radius_ratio: 0.1

explorer:
  ram_threshold_gb: 4
  pixel_size: 1
```

### Step 4: Run sopa with defaults

There are three paths you need to pass to the snakemake command:

1. path to your image
2. path to the edited config file
3. path to the workflow profile (provided by sopa download)

For the demo image copy:  
`RD_Coscia/Jose/__TestDatasets/TD_01_verysmall_mIF.ome.tif`  
and place it in here:  
`sopa/data/TD_01_verysmall_mIF.ome.tif`

```bash
# go to the sopa directory
cd sopa
# activate environment
mamba activate sopa

# run snakemake
snakemake \
    --config data_path=./data/TD_01_verysmall_mIF.ome.tif \
    --configfile= ./workflow/configs/misc/ome_tif.yaml \
    --workflow-profile ./workflow/profile/local \
    --cores 2

# for Windows you must replace:
# <\> with a caret (^) for the traditional Command Prompt (cmd.exe) and a backtick (`) for PowerShell.
# you can also remove them and create a single line command in an editor, and then copy paste.
```

### Run SOPA on HPC

- Create environment with `snakemake`, `snakemake-slurm`, and `snakemake-executor-plugin-slurm`.
- Use profile that will use the executor plugin
- For MDC peeps check [Snakemake with Slurm](https://hpc-docs.cubi.bihealth.org/slurm/snakemake/)
